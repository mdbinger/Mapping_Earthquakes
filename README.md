# Mapping Earthquakes
### Module 13 of Data Analytics Bootcamp


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
Use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Approach
Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
